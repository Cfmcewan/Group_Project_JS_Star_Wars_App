# Group Project JS Star Wars App
Star Wars app in Java Script, using an existing JSON API (SWAPI) to populate our app, presenting information on Star Wars and creating multiple choice quizzes using a MongoDB database.  As product owner I supported the team to manage our workload into sprints using lean methods of Kanban and a Trello board to record our steps. 	
We used a Pub/Sub pattern to manage our MVC, created a modular frontend and wrote requests using a RESTful API.  

Project Goals:
-  For Star Wars fans to increase their knowledge 
-  For Star Wars fans to have fun trying multiple choice quizzes to test their knowledge
-  Allow the user to create a profile and store their scores and compare with future users of the site
-  To enhance the learning experience around the Star Wars Franchise

MVP
-  Users should be able to select from categories such as; characters, planets, vehicles, star ships to see information from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/uk)
-  Users should be able to take choice of multiple choice quizzes and view their final scores

To run the app from terminal:

1.  npm install
2.  mongod
3.  npm run build
4.  npm run server:dev
5.  in browser: https://localhost:3000
